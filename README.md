# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
This is my first attempt at Game Development.

In this project I have used the Godot game engine to make a simple game similar to the Dinosaur game by Google. I chose this game to understand the basics and working of the Godot Engine for a 2D-Game.

# PROJECT DETAILS
As mentioned above I used the Godot Engine and it's own scripting language GDScript. I was a little hesitant to use GDScript but, it was very similar to Python, due to which I was able to get a hang of the language pretty quickly.
The game consists of a cat jumping over the obstacles present in its path. There is also a Main Screen which displays the game name along with the highscore and instructions to play. The Level Screen consists of the Cat, obstacles, score count, background and foreground elements.

The game is no way perfect, but it was a great learning experience.
